## 2024-11-20

- Add support for background image colorization [PR 1815](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontra/pull/1815)

## 2024-11-18

New feature: background images.

A background image can be added to a glyph in three ways:

- Paste image data
- Drop an image file onto the canvas
- Choose an image file from the user's hard drive, with the "Glyph" -> "Add background image..." menu.

The image file or data can be in PNG or JPEG format.

The glyph needs to be in edit mode, and at a selected source (not at an interpolation).

Fontra's background image feature is mostly compatible with UFO background images, although it doesn't implement UFO's colorization feature yet. Fontra does allow the opacity of the image to be set.

Background images are locked by default, and can be unlocked with the "Unlock background images" context menu item.

Selected background images can be moved around by dragging, and they participate in the Selection Transformation panel's operations.

The Selection Info panel shows the settings for a selected background image: the Opacity can be edited there and the Transformation settings can be edited numerically there.

Caveat: support for background images is limited to the `.designspace`/`.ufo` and `.fontra` backends. It is currently not supported in the `rcjk` backend.
